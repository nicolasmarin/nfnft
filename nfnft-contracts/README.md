# nfNFT contracts

Refer to the README on the parent folder for general information about the project.

`ContractsFactory` requires `NFERC721` to be compiled, while `NFERC721` can be compiled independently.

To compile, you can use hardhat, or just C&P into Remix and press compile. Despite the pragma being set to ^0.8.20, the target of the compiler must be set depending on the target EVM.
